#### Comix CBR Server

This project hopes to be a simple Python web server to provide CBR and CBZ files and details of those files via json. Once that lives, an HTML CBR consumer should also be added to make the whole thing nice and self-contained, even if no one uses it.

### TODO

* Stuff is getting messy and hard to understand, clean up code and comment
* Review naming conventions (file v issue v path v whatever)
* Figure out how to properly raise a 404

Concept: consume a directory (or directories?) and return JSON at a few URL patterns
    root = titles I know about
    /name = issues of a given title
    /name/issue id = json dump of {page & image urls}
    /name/issue id/page = image url

Issues
    file name formatting is incredibly inconsistent
        ignore all the shit in parentheses
    issue numbering is something of a mess
        once you figure out file name concept, strip out leading 0s to prevent 010 being in front of 02
